# Advent of Code 2018 in Rust

What is the best way to learn something new? Repetition.

What is the best way to learn a new programming language? Using it.

I always put off learning Rust,
always taking the complex looking code I found online as an excuse.  
Now I have decided to actually start writing Rust. But what to write?  
Because I don't know, I just started doing the Advent of Code from 2018.

This usually is how I get into languages.  
I did the same for Elixir, which is by far my most favorite functional language now.  
And every time I use another language, I start missing features from Elixir!

Please know that this is obviously my first time writing Rust,
most of the code is NOT going to be optimized by any stretch.

As I often rewrite my code, while learning, I might actually have a pretty
optimized version.  

An example would be the Day 1 Part 2 solution, before using HashSet I used a Vec.  
If you don't know, that is a bad idea. Using a Vec resulted in minutes of runtime,  
switching to a HashSet made the solution finish in less than 300 ms.
